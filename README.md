# AI_for_Robotics
This is typically programs that are expanded solutions to the "AI for Robotics" class taught by Sebastian Thrun. The course is free to take and I would recommend doing that and working out your own solutions. These are just my efforts to turn them into more real-world software.

Apart from watching the lectures, ideally read the relevant sections of the book "Probabilistic Robotics" by Sebastian Thrun et al. My advise would be to:
For each lecture section
1. Watch the lectures
2. Solve the excercises
3. Read the relevant sections of the book
4. Do the derivations yourself till you completely understand the math
5. Solve the end of chapter problems
6. Repeat
